                    <p>Mastery of swords is more than just technique, to defeat those better than you, you have to think like them, be like them and learn their technique. You have to fight like them only a student has the chance of defeating the master. If you have come to tell me what a horrible person I am, I am afraid you will have to wait in a very long line. I salute your persistence</p>
